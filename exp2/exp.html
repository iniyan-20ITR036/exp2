        <p> laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen and
            alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the inside
            of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable
            keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for
            transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed practical
            to be placed on a person's lap when being used. Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at
            work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer
            use</p>

        <p>A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to
            simply mobile, cell, or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio
            frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link
            establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the
            public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network
            architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in North
            America. In addition to telephony, digital mobile phones (2G) support a variety of other services, such as
            text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth),
            business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities

        <p> tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system
            and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and flat package.
            Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities
            that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only differences being that
            tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured
            diagonally,[1][2][3][4] and may not support access to a cellular network.

            The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the
